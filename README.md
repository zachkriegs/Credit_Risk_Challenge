# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
- The purpose of this analysis was to determine which loans were high and loan risk and if the machine learning model could determine which would be successful or not. 

## Results
- The balanced accuracy score of the Oversampling model was 0.687.
- The balanced accuracy score of the Undersampling model was 0.654.
- The balanced accuracy score of the Combination model was 0.528.
- The balanced accuracy score of the Random Forest Classifier model was 0.996.
- The balanced accuracy score of the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier model was 0.992.


## Summary 
- The results of the machine learning models show that the Random Forest Classifier model would be the most accurate in determining the whether a loan would classify as high-risk or low-risk. The most likely reason for this is the random variables it assigns, whereas the other models are looking for correlations in the dataset that are artifically made.
